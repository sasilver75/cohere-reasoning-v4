A: The graph of the function passes through the point $(1,2)$.

B: The graph of the function lies in the first and third quadrants.

C: The value of $y$ increases as $x$ increases.

D: When $x < -1$, the value of $y$ increases as $x$ increases.","Given that the point $(-1,2)$ lies on the graph of the inverse proportion function $y=\frac{k}{x}$, where $k$ is a constant and $k\neq 0$, we can find the value of $k$ by substituting the coordinates of the point into the equation. 

Step 1: Substitute $x = -1$ and $y = 2$ into the equation $y = \frac{k}{x}$.
\[2 = \frac{k}{-1}\]

Step 2: Solve for $k$.
\[k = 2 \times (-1) = -2\]

Thus, we have determined that $k = -2$. This means the equation of the function is $y = \frac{-2}{x}$.

Step 3: Analyze the behavior of the function based on the value of $k$.
- Since $k$ is negative, the graph of the function lies in the second and fourth quadrants where the signs of $x$ and $y$ are opposite.
- In each of these quadrants, as $x$ increases (moves away from zero), $y$ becomes less negative (increases).

Therefore, options $B$ (the graph lies in the first and third quadrants) and $C$ (the value of $y$ increases as $x$ increases) are incorrect because they do not match the characteristics of the function with $k = -2$.

Step 4: Check the validity of option $A$.
- To see if the graph passes through the point $(1,2)$, substitute $x = 1$ into the equation $y = \frac{-2}{x}$.
\[y = \frac{-2}{1} = -2\]
- Since $y = -2$ when $x = 1$, the graph does not pass through the point $(1,2)$. Thus, option $A$ is incorrect.

Step 5: Confirm the correctness of option $D$.
- For $x < -1$, as $x$ increases (moves towards zero from the left), $y$ (which is negative) becomes less negative, meaning it increases. This matches the description in option $D$.

Step 1: Solve the inequality $x^{2}-3x-4 \lt 0$.

\[x^{2}-3x-4 = (x-4)(x+1)\]

Setting the inequality to zero, we find the critical points:

From this, we can determine the intervals that satisfy the inequality. The critical points divide the number line into intervals. We test points in each interval to see if they satisfy the inequality:

- For $x \gt 4$, choose $x = 5$: $(5-4)(5+1) = 6 \gt 0$, so this interval does not satisfy the inequality.

D: $\{-3,1\}$","To solve this problem, we first need to find the set $N$ by solving the inequality $x^{2}-3x-4 \lt 0$. 

Step 1: Solve the inequality $x^{2}-3x-4 \lt 0$.

We can factor the quadratic equation as follows:
\[x^{2}-3x-4 = (x-4)(x+1)\]

Setting the inequality to zero, we find the critical points:
\[(x-4)(x+1) \lt 0\]

From this, we can determine the intervals that satisfy the inequality. The critical points divide the number line into intervals. We test points in each interval to see if they satisfy the inequality:
- For $x \lt -1$, choose $x = -2$: $(-2-4)(-2+1) = 6 \gt 0$, so this interval does not satisfy the inequality.
- For $-1 \lt x \lt 4$, choose $x = 0$: $(0-4)(0+1) = -4 \lt 0$, so this interval satisfies the inequality.
- For $x \gt 4$, choose $x = 5$: $(5-4)(5+1) = 6 \gt 0$, so this interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $-1 \lt x \lt 4$, which means $N=\{x|-1 \lt x \lt 4\}$.

Step 2: Find the intersection $M \cap N$.

Given $M=\{-3,1,3\}$ and $N=\{x|-1 \lt x \lt 4\}$, we compare the elements of $M$ with the interval for $N$:
- $-3$ is not in the interval $(-1, 4)$.
- $1$ is in the interval $(-1, 4)$.
- $3$ is also in the interval $(-1, 4)$.

Therefore, $M \cap N = \{1, 3\}$.

Step 3: Match the answer to the given options.

The intersection $M \cap N = \{1, 3\}$ matches with option B: $\{1,3\}$.

Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{B}$.",2,[Solution Placeholder],[Verification Reasoning Placeholder],False,"If we visualize this problem as a series of overlapping triangles and examine their shared angles,"

(III) Let $S\_n$ be the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence $\{ \frac {1}{a\_n}\}$. Prove that $1-( \frac {2}{3})^{n}\leqslant S\_n < 1$.","(I) We will prove that $a_{n+1} > a\_n$ by showing that $a_{n+1}-a\_n > 0$.
$$a_{n+1}-a\_n = \frac{1}{2}(a\_n^{2}-2a\_n+4)-a\_n = \frac{1}{2}(a\_n-2)^{2} \geqslant 0$$
Since $a\_n \geqslant 3$ (given that $a\_1=3$ and assuming $a\_n$ is an increasing sequence), we have $(a\_n-2)^{2} > 0$. Thus,
$$a_{n+1}-a\_n > 0 \quad \text{and hence,} \quad a_{n+1} > a\_n.$$

(II) We start with the given equation, $2a_{n+1}-4=a\_n^{2}-2a\_n$. Now, let's manipulate this equation:
$$\frac{a_{n+1}-2}{a\_n-2} = \frac{a\_n}{2} \geqslant \frac{3}{2}.$$
By multiplying both sides by $(a\_n-2)$ and applying the inequality repeatedly, we obtain
$$a\_n-2 \geqslant \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n-1}(a\_1-2) = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n-1}.$$
Therefore,
$$a\_n \geqslant 2+ \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n-1}.$$

(III) First, we rewrite the given equation as follows:
$$\frac{1}{2(a_{n+1}-2)} = \frac{1}{a\_n(a\_n-2)} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{a\_n-2} - \frac{1}{a\_n} \right).$$
Taking reciprocals and rearranging,
$$\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-2} = \frac{1}{a\_n-2} - \frac{1}{a\_n}.$$
Now, let's express $\frac{1}{a\_n}$ in terms of $\frac{1}{a\_{n+1}-2}$ and $\frac{1}{a\_n-2}$:
$$\frac{1}{a\_n} = -\frac{1}{a\_{n+1}-2} + \frac{1}{a\_n-2}.$$
Summing the first $n$ terms of the sequence $\{\frac{1}{a\_n}\}$,
$$S\_n = \frac{1}{a\_1} + \frac{1}{a\_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{a\_n} = \frac{1}{a\_1-2} - \frac{1}{a\_{n+1}-2} = 1 - \frac{1}{a\_{n+1}-2}.$$
Since $a\_{n+1}-2 \geqslant \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n}$, we have
$$0 < \frac{1}{a\_{n+1}-2} \leqslant \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^{n}.$$

(II) We start with the given equation, $2a_{n+1}-4=a\_n^{2}-2a\_n$. Now, let's manipulate this equation:
$$\frac{a_{n+1}-2}{a\_n-2} = \frac{a\_n}{2} \geqslant \frac{3}{2}.$$
By multiplying both sides by $(a\_n-2)$ and applying the inequality repeatedly, we obtain
$$a\_n-2 \geqslant \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n-1}(a\_1-2) = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n-1}.$$

$$\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-2} = \frac{1}{a\_n-2} - \frac{1}{a\_n}.$$
Now, let's express $\frac{1}{a\_n}$ in terms of $\frac{1}{a\_{n+1}-2}$ and $\frac{1}{a\_n-2}$:
$$\frac{1}{a\_n} = -\frac{1}{a\_{n+1}-2} + \frac{1}{a\_n-2}.$$

Since $a\_{n+1}-2 \geqslant \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{n}$, we have

To isolate $z$, we divide both sides of the equation by $(1-2i)$:
$$ z = \frac{4+2i}{1-2i} $$

Multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get:
$$ z = \frac{(4+2i)(1+2i)}{(1-2i)(1+2i)} $$

Expanding the numerator, we obtain:
$$ z = \frac{4+8i+2i-4i^2}{1^2-(2i)^2} $$

Since $i^2 = -1$, simplifying further results in:
$$ z = \frac{4+10i+4}{1+4} $$
$$ z = \frac{8+10i}{5} $$
$$ z = \frac{8}{5} + 2i $$

The magnitude of a complex number $z = a+bi$ is given by $|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.
Hence, for our $z$:
$$ |z| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{8}{5}\right)^2 + (2)^2} $$
$$ |z| = \sqrt{\frac{64}{25} + 4} $$
$$ |z| = \sqrt{\frac{64}{25} + \frac{100}{25}} $$
$$ |z| = \sqrt{\frac{164}{25}} $$
$$ |z| = \frac{\sqrt{164}}{5} $$

Note that the answer should be a positive real number, as the magnitude of a complex number is always non-negative. Conservatively simplifying the numerator under the radical:
$$ |z| = \frac{\sqrt{4 \cdot 41}}{5} $$
$$ |z| = \frac{2\sqrt{41}}{5} $$

What is the minimum total cost of purchasing tents?","### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Part 1: Finding the Price of Each Tent

Let's denote the price of each tent of type $A$ as $m$ yuan, and the price of each tent of type $B$ as $n$ yuan. We are given two scenarios:

1. Buying $2$ tents of type $A$ and $4$ tents of type $B$ costs $5200$ yuan.
2. Buying $3$ tents of type $A$ and $1$ tent of type $B$ costs $2800$ yuan.

This translates to the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
2m + 4n &= 5200 \\
3m + n &= 2800
\end{align*}
\]

Solving this system, we multiply the second equation by $4$ to eliminate $n$:
\[
\begin{align*}
2m + 4n &= 5200 \\
12m + 4n &= 11200
\end{align*}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
\[
\begin{align*}
10m &= 6000 \\
m &= 600
\end{align*}
\]

Plugging $m = 600$ into the second original equation:
\[
\begin{align*}
3(600) + n &= 2800 \\
1800 + n &= 2800 \\
n &= 1000
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the price of each tent of type $A$ is $600$ yuan, and the price of each tent of type $B$ is $1000$ yuan. So, we have:
\[
\boxed{m = 600 \text{ yuan}, n = 1000 \text{ yuan}}

#### Part 2: Minimizing the Total Cost of Purchasing Tents

Let $x$ represent the number of type $A$ tents purchased, and $w$ represent the total cost in yuan. The number of type $B$ tents purchased will then be $(20-x)$. Given that the number of type $A$ tents does not exceed $\frac{1}{3}$ of the number of type $B$ tents, we have:
\[
x \leqslant \frac{1}{3}(20-x)
\]

Solving this inequality:
\[
\begin{align*}
x &\leqslant \frac{20}{4} - \frac{x}{3} \\
4x &\leqslant 5 - x \\
5x &\leqslant 5 \\
x &\leqslant 1
\end{align*}
\]

The total cost $w$ is given by:
\[
w = 600x + 1000(20-x) = -400x + 20000
\]

Since $-400 < 0$, the total cost $w$ decreases as $x$ increases. Therefore, to minimize $w$, we set $x$ to its maximum value under the constraint, which is $5$. Substituting $x = 5$ into the cost equation:
\[
w = -400(5) + 20000 = 18000
\]

Thus, the scenic area should purchase $5$ tents of type $A$ and $15$ tents of type $B$ to minimize the total cost, which is $\boxed{18000 \text{ yuan}}$.",0,[Solution Placeholder],[Verification Reasoning Placeholder],False,"When we distribute these terms and carefully track what happens to each part,"

#### Part 1: Finding the Price of Each Tent

Let's denote the price of each tent of type $A$ as $m$ yuan, and the price of each tent of type $B$ as $n$ yuan. We are given two scenarios:

1. Buying $2$ tents of type $A$ and $4$ tents of type $B$ costs $5200$ yuan.
2. Buying $3$ tents of type $A$ and $1$ tent of type $B$ costs $2800$ yuan.

This translates to the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
2m + 4n &= 5200 \\
3m + n &= 2800
\end{align*}
\]

Solving this system, we multiply the second equation by $4$ to eliminate $n$:
\[
\begin{align*}
2m + 4n &= 5200 \\
12m + 4n &= 11200
\end{align*}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
\[
\begin{align*}
10m &= 6000 \\
m &= 600
\end{align*}
\]

Plugging $m = 600$ into the second original equation:
\[
\begin{align*}
3(600) + n &= 2800 \\
1800 + n &= 2800 \\
n &= 1000
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the price of each tent of type $A$ is $600$ yuan, and the price of each tent of type $B$ is $1000$ yuan. So, we have:
\[
\boxed{m = 600 \text{ yuan}, n = 1000 \text{ yuan}}

This problem requires finding the range of a real number, and involves solving a system of inequalities. Properly converting the propositions is key to solving the problem, making this a basic question.

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. Solve the inequality $2x^2 - 3x + 1 \leqslant 0$ to obtain $\frac{1}{2} \leqslant x \leqslant 1$, which represents proposition $p$: $\frac{1}{2} \leqslant x \leqslant 1$.

3. Since $\lnot p$ is not a necessary and sufficient condition for $\lnot q$, it's equivalent to the contrapositive: $q$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for $p$.

**For option A:**

Given $\lambda =0$, we have $\overrightarrow{a}=(1,0)$, thus $\overrightarrow{a}+\overrightarrow{b}=(1-2,0+1)=(-1,1)$. The magnitude of this sum vector is calculated as:
\[
|\overrightarrow{a}+\overrightarrow{b}|=\sqrt{(-1)^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}

Thus, option B is correct.

**For option C:**

The condition for the angle between $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\overrightarrow{b}$ to be acute is $\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} > 0$. Calculating the dot product gives:
\[
\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = 1 \cdot (-2) + \lambda \cdot 1 = -2 + \lambda
\]
For this to be greater than 0, we need $-2 + \lambda > 0$, which simplifies to $\lambda > 2$. This contradicts the statement in option C, making it incorrect.

2. Recall that the sum of the distances from any point on an ellipse to its two foci remains constant and is equal to the length of the major axis. In this case, the major axis has length $2a$, so $d\_1 + d\_2 = 2a$.

3. We can apply the cosine rule in $\triangle PF\_1 F\_2$ to find the side lengths $d\_1$ and $d\_2$:

$$
\begin{align}
d_1^2 &= d_2^2 + (2a)^2 - 2d_2(2a) \cdot \cos(60^{\circ}) \\

\begin{align}
\Delta\_{max} &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (2ad\_2 - d\_2^2) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (2a^2 - a^2) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot a^2 \\
\end{align}
$$

11. Since the problem asks for an exact value, we must find the value of $a$. But, the problem statement only provides $a > 2$. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific value for the area. However, we can observe that the area is a fraction of $a^2$, which means the area must be a multiple of $\sqrt{3}$.

If they produce $20$ teddy bears per day, they will be $100$ short of the order. If they produce $23$ teddy bears per day, they will exceed the order by $20$. Find out how many teddy bears were ordered and how many days were originally planned to complete the task.","### Method 1: 

**Step 1:** Let $x$ be the number of days originally planned to complete the task.

**Step 2:** Set up the equations based on the given information. If they produce $20$ teddy bears per day, they will be $100$ short of the order, which gives us the equation $20x + 100$. If they produce $23$ teddy bears per day, they will exceed the order by $20$, leading to the equation $23x - 20$.

**Step 3:** Equate the two expressions to find the number of days: 
\[20x + 100 = 23x - 20\]

**Step 4:** Solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
100 + 20 &= 23x - 20x \\
100 + 20 &= 3x \\
120 &= 3x \\
x &= 40

**Step 5:** Find the total number of teddy bears ordered using the equation $20x + 100$:
\[20(40) + 100 = 800 + 100 = 900\]

**Final Answer:** The number of teddy bears ordered is $\boxed{900}$, and the task was originally planned to be completed in $\boxed{40}$ days.

### Method 2:

**Step 1:** Let $x$ be the number of teddy bears ordered.

**Step 2:** Set up the equations based on the given information. The number of days to complete the order if $20$ teddy bears are made per day and they are $100$ short is $\frac{x - 100}{20}$. If $23$ teddy bears are made per day and they exceed the order by $20$, it is $\frac{x + 20}{23}$.

**Step 3:** Equate the two expressions to find the number of teddy bears ordered:
\[\frac{x - 100}{20} = \frac{x + 20}{23}\]

**Step 4:** Solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
23(x - 100) &= 20(x + 20) \\
23x - 2300 &= 20x + 400 \\

**Step 1:** Let $x$ be the number of days originally planned to complete the task.

**Step 2:** Set up the equations based on the given information. If they produce $20$ teddy bears per day, they will be $100$ short of the order, which gives us the equation $20x + 100$.

C: $\left[0,e\right]$

D: $\left[1,e\right]$","To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given inequality $e^{ax}\geqslant 2\ln x+x^{2}-ax$. We can rearrange and enhance this inequality to better understand the conditions under which it holds. 

1. **Rearrange the Inequality:**
   \[
   e^{ax} + ax \geqslant 2\ln x + x^{2}
   \]
   This can be further interpreted by recognizing a common form on both sides of the inequality.

2. **Recognize the Common Form:**
   \[
   e^{ax} + ax \geqslant e^{\ln x^{2}} + \ln x^{2}
   \]
   Here, we use the identity $e^{\ln x} = x$ to rewrite $x^{2}$ as $e^{\ln x^{2}}$.

3. **Define a Function:**
   Let's define a function $f(x) = e^{x} + x$. This allows us to rewrite the inequality in terms of $f(x)$:
   \[
   f(ax) \geqslant f(\ln x^{2})
   \]

4. **Analyze the Function $f(x)$:**
   The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = e^{x} + 1$. Since $e^{x} + 1 > 0$ for all real $x$, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $\mathbb{R}$.

5. **Infer from Monotonicity:**
   Given that $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing, if $f(ax) \geqslant f(\ln x^{2})$, it implies $ax \geqslant \ln x^{2}$.

   From $ax \geqslant \ln x^{2}$, we get:
   \[
   a \geqslant \frac{\ln x^{2}}{x} = \frac{2\ln x}{x}

   \[
   g'(x) = \frac{2(1 - \ln x)}{x^{2}}

   This shows that $g(x)$ is monotonically increasing in $[1, e]$ since $g'(x) \geqslant 0$ for $x \in [1, e]$.

8. **Determine the Range of $g(x)$:**

B: $[m^3, +\infty)$

C: $(0, (\frac{m}{3})^3]$

D: $[(\frac{m}{3})^3, +\infty)$","Since the sum of the geometric sequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$ is a constant $3m$ ($m>0$), and the common ratio is $q$ ($q>0$),

we have $a_1+a_2+a_3 = 3m = \frac{a_2}{q} + a_2 + a_2q = a_2 + a_2(q + \frac{1}{q}) \geq a_2 + 2a_2 = 3a_2$.

Therefore, $a_2 \leq m$.

Thus, $t=a_1a_2a_3 = a_2^3 \leq m^3$.

Since $m>0$, we have $0 < t \leq m^3$.

Hence, the correct choice is: $\boxed{\text{A}}$.

By utilizing the properties of geometric sequences and the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, we can deduce that $a_2 \leq m$, which allows us to determine the range of values for $t=a_1a_2a_3$.

#### Part (1): Finding the Coordinates of Points $A$, $B$, and $C$

- **For Point $C$:**

  When $x=0$, we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola $y=x^{2}+2x-3$ to find the $y$-coordinate:
  \[
  y = 0^{2} + 2(0) - 3 = -3
  \]
  Therefore, the coordinates of point $C$ are:
  \[
  C(0, -3)

- **For Points $A$ and $B$:**

  When $y=0$, we solve the equation $x^{2}+2x-3=0$ to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$:
  \[
  x^{2}+2x-3=0

324,"From the ""Zhang Qiujian's Art of Mathematics,"" there is a problem: ""There is a girl who is not good at weaving. The amount of cloth she weaves decreases by the same amount each day. On the first day, she weaves five feet, and on the last day she weaves one foot, taking a total of thirty days."" Based on this, deduce the percentage of the total amount of cloth woven in thirty days that the girl has completed by the eleventh day:
A: 49%
B: 53%
C: 61%
D: 88%","Let's denote the common difference of the arithmetic sequence by $d$. Hence, according to the problem statement we can equate the last term of the sequence to the first term plus 29 times the common difference: 
$$1 = 5 + 29d.$$
Solving this equation, we get 
$$d = -\frac{4}{29}.$$

Now, let's compute the sum of the sequence for the first 11 days, $S_{11}$, which is the sum of an arithmetic series:
$$S_{11} = 5 \times 11 + \left(-\frac{4}{29}\right) \times \frac{11 \times 10}{2} = \frac{1375}{29}.$$

To find the total sum for 30 days, $S_{30}$, we apply the same formula:
$$S_{30} = 30 \times 5 + \left(-\frac{4}{29}\right) \times \frac{30 \times 29}{2} = 90.$$

Calculating the ratio of $S_{11}$ to $S_{30}$, to determine the percentage completed by the 11th day, we get:
$$\frac{S_{11}}{S_{30}} = \frac{\frac{1375}{29}}{90} = 53\%.$$

Therefore, the correct option is:
$$\boxed{B: 53\%}.$$

Thus, the loop stops after we surpass the sum of $196$, which is the sum of the first $14$ odd numbers. The next odd number that would have been added to $S$ is $2 \cdot 14 + 1 = 29$, but since $15^2 = 225$ exceeds 200, we do not add it.

- The value of $S$ just before exceeding 200 is $14^2 = 196$.
- The final value of $i$ before stopping the loop is $29$.
- Therefore, $n = i - 2 = 29 - 2$.

A. $-3 < a < 1$
B. $-2 < a < 0$
C. $-1 < a < 0$
D. $0 < a < 2$","Let's denote the roots of the quadratic equation as $\alpha$ and $\beta$. According to Viète's formulas, we have:
$$ \alpha + \beta = -(a^2+1) $$
$$ \alpha\beta = a - 2 $$

We are given that one root is greater than 1, and the other is less than -1. Without loss of generality, let's assume $\alpha > 1$ and $\beta < -1$. 

1. Since $\alpha > 1$, it must follow that $\alpha\beta < \alpha<-1$. Thus, we have $a - 2 < -1,$ and therefore, $a < 1$.

2. By similar reasoning, since $\beta < -1$, then $\alpha\beta > \beta >1$, which implies $a - 2 > 1$ and so $a > 3$.

Combining these two inequalities, we find that $3 < a < 1$, which is impossible since there is no number which is both greater than 3 and less than 1 at the same time.

This means that we must reconsider the assumptions about $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Since $\alpha\beta = a - 2$, the product of the roots is positive, which suggests that both roots have the same sign.

Given that the sum of the roots $\alpha + \beta$ is negative (it equals $-(a^2+1)$, which is always negative as $a^2 + 1$ is always positive), both roots must be negative to meet both Viète's formulas and the given conditions. This means we should instead assume $\alpha < -1$ and $\beta < -1$.

Now, let's find the range for $a$ based on the fact that the discriminant must be non-negative for the real roots to exist:
$$ (a^2+1)^2 - 4(a-2) \geq 0 $$
$$ a^4 + 2a^2 + 1 - 4a + 8 \geq 0 $$
$$ a^4 + 2a^2 - 4a + 9 \geq 0 $$

This inequality holds for all $a$ because the left-hand side is a sum of a quartic function, which is always positive, and other positive terms.

Now, we must also ensure that the quadratic function increases after the root greater than -1 and decreases before the root less than -1, which leads to the derivative of the quadratic function with respect to $x$ being greater than zero: 
$$ 2x + (a^2+1) > 0 $$

When $x = -1$, we must have:
$$ -2 + (a^2 + 1) > 0 $$
$$ a^2 - 1 > 0 $$
$$ a^2 > 1 $$
$$ a > 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a < -1 $$

Since we also have to satisfy $3 < a < 1$ inferred from the roots, which we've shown cannot happen, we now focus on the range that was deduced from the derivative being positive when $x = -1$, which is $a > 1$. Let's also verify this with $x = 1$, as one of the roots should be greater.

When $x = 1$, we must have:
$$ 2 + (a^2 + 1) > 0 $$
which is always true. There is no need to consider $x = 1$ further as it does not give us more information about the range of $a$.

Taking all factors into consideration, the only valid range for $a$ that satisfies all the conditions is $a > 1$. Among the given options, only $0 < a < 2$ conforms and includes values greater than 1. Hence, our answer is:

Combining these two inequalities, we find that $3 < a < 1$, which is impossible since there is no number which is both greater than 3 and less than 1 at the same time.

This means that we must reconsider the assumptions about $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Since $\alpha\beta = a - 2$, the product of the roots is positive, which suggests that both roots have the same sign.

Given that the sum of the roots $\alpha + \beta$ is negative (it equals $-(a^2+1)$, which is always negative as $a^2 + 1$ is always positive), both roots must be negative to meet both Viète's formulas and the given conditions. This means we should instead assume $\alpha < -1$ and $\beta < -1$.

Now, let's find the range for $a$ based on the fact that the discriminant must be non-negative for the real roots to exist:
$$ (a^2+1)^2 - 4(a-2) \geq 0 $$
$$ a^4 + 2a^2 + 1 - 4a + 8 \geq 0 $$
$$ a^4 + 2a^2 - 4a + 9 \geq 0 $$

This inequality holds for all $a$ because the left-hand side is a sum of a quartic function, which is always positive, and other positive terms.

Now, we must also ensure that the quadratic function increases after the root greater than -1 and decreases before the root less than -1, which leads to the derivative of the quadratic function with respect to $x$ being greater than zero: 
$$ 2x + (a^2+1) > 0 $$

When $x = -1$, we must have:
$$ -2 + (a^2 + 1) > 0 $$
$$ a^2 - 1 > 0 $$
$$ a^2 > 1 $$
$$ a > 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a < -1 $$

Since we also have to satisfy $3 < a < 1$ inferred from the roots, which we've shown cannot happen, we now focus on the range that was deduced from the derivative being positive when $x = -1$, which is $a > 1$. Let's also verify this with $x = 1$, as one of the roots should be greater.

When $x = 1$, we must have:
$$ 2 + (a^2 + 1) > 0 $$
which is always true. There is no need to consider $x = 1$ further as it does not give us more information about the range of $a$.

Taking all factors into consideration, the only valid range for $a$ that satisfies all the conditions is $a > 1$. Among the given options, only $0 < a < 2$ conforms and includes values greater than 1. Hence, our answer is:

$$ \alpha\beta = a - 2 $$

We are given that one root is greater than 1, and the other is less than -1. Without loss of generality, let's assume $\alpha > 1$ and $\beta < -1$. 

1. Since $\alpha > 1$, it must follow that $\alpha\beta < \alpha<-1$. Thus, we have $a - 2 < -1,$ and therefore, $a < 1$.

2. By similar reasoning, since $\beta < -1$, then $\alpha\beta > \beta >1$, which implies $a - 2 > 1$ and so $a > 3$.

The function after shifting is: $g(x)=\sin \left(2x+\varphi+ \frac{\pi}{3}\right)$,

Since $g(x)$ is an even function,

Then $\varphi= \frac{\pi}{6}$,

Thus, $f(x)=\sin \left(2x+ \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$,

Since $a_n=f(\frac{n\pi}{6})$,

Then $a_n=\sin \left( \frac{n}{3}\pi+ \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$,

Therefore, $\{a_n\}$ is a periodic sequence with a period of $6$,

And $a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6$,

$=\sin \frac{\pi}{2}+\sin \frac{5\pi}{6}+\sin \frac{7\pi}{6}+\sin \frac{3\pi}{2}+\sin \frac{11\pi}{6}+\sin \frac{13\pi}{6}$,

$=0$,

Therefore, the sum of the first $2018$ terms of $\{a_n\}$ is:

- This implies $\cos\angle AOB = 0 \Rightarrow \angle AOB = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
- Similar reasoning shows $\angle AOC = \frac{3\pi}{4}$ and $\angle COB = \frac{3\pi}{4}$.
- Because $\angle AOB = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and the vertices lie on the circumference, $BC = AC$, making $\triangle ABC$ isosceles.

#### Option D: Calculating the magnitude of vector sum
- Given $|\overrightarrow{a} - \overrightarrow{b}| = 4$, squaring gives $\overrightarrow{a}^2 + \overrightarrow{b}^2 - 2\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = 16$.
- Given $\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = 1$, substituting yields $\overrightarrow{a}^2 + \overrightarrow{b}^2 = 18$.
- For $|\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b}|$, we compute $(\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b})^2 = \overrightarrow{a}^2 + \overrightarrow{b}^2 + 2\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = 18 + 2 = 20$.
- Therefore, $|\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b}| = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}$, not $\sqrt{5}$.

The slope of the tangent at point $M\left(\frac{4}{t}, 2\right)$ is $\sqrt{t} \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\frac{4}{t}}} = \frac{t}{4}$,

Thus, the equation of the tangent line is $y - 2 = \frac{t}{4}(x - \frac{4}{t})$, i.e., $y = \frac{t}{4}x + 1$,

Let the tangent point be $(m, n)$, then for curve $C_2$: $y = e^{x+1} - 1$,

- a + 4 = 0 \\

\]

In this case, $m = (a-1)^2 = (4-1)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.

In conclusion, the values of $a$ and $m$ are:

- When $a=2$, $m=1$.
- When $a=4$, $m=9$.

Given that the square root of a non-negative number is $2a-1$ and $a-5$, we can set up the equation:

\[
(2a-1) + (a-5) = 0
\]

Solving for $a$:

\[
2a - 1 + a - 5 = 0 \\
3a - 6 = 0 \\
3a = 6 \\
a = 2
\]

Therefore, the non-negative number is:

\[
(2a-1)^2 = (2 \times 2 - 1)^2 = (4 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9
\]

So, the non-negative number is $\boxed{9}$.

### Problem 2: Finding the Values of $a$ and $m$

Given that $a-1$ and $5-2a$ are both square roots of $m$, we consider two cases:

#### Case 1: $a-1$ and $5-2a$ are the same square root

Setting $a-1 = 5-2a$, we solve for $a$:

\[
a - 1 = 5 - 2a \\
3a = 6 \\
a = 2
\]

In this case, $m = (a-1)^2 = (2-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.

#### Case 2: $a-1$ and $5-2a$ are two different square roots

Setting $a-1 + 5-2a = 0$, we solve for $a$:

\[
a - 1 + 5 - 2a = 0 \\
- a + 4 = 0 \\
a = 4
\]

In this case, $m = (a-1)^2 = (4-1)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.

In conclusion, the values of $a$ and $m$ are:

- When $a=2$, $m=1$.
- When $a=4$, $m=9$.

Now, substitute $a = 2$ into the given polynomial and expand it using the binomial theorem.

$$(2 \sqrt{x}- \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}})^{6}\cdot (x^{2}+2) = (64x^{3}−192x^{2}+240x−160+60⋅ \frac{1}{x}−12⋅ \frac{1}{x^{2}}+ \frac{1}{x^{3}})(x^{2}+2)$$

To find the constant term, we need to focus on the terms that make the exponent of $x$ equal to zero after multiplication with $(x^{2}+2)$. These terms are $-12\cdot \frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $-160$.

The constant term is therefore $-12\cdot 2 - 160 = -24 - 160 = -332$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{-332}$.",2,[Solution Placeholder],[Verification Reasoning Placeholder],False,"If we visualize this problem as a series of overlapping triangles and examine their shared angles,"

This implies that $\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} = 1$ and thus, $b = \sqrt{2}$.

Since the ellipse passes through the point $(1, \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3})$, we substitute these values into the equation of the ellipse:

$\frac{1}{a^{2}} + \frac{4}{3b^{2}} = 1$

Solving for $a$, we get $a = \sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse $C$ is $\frac{x^{2}}{3} + \frac{y^{2}}{2} = 1$.

(II) Let $Q(x\_0, y\_0)$, $M(x\_1, y\_1)$, and $N(x\_2, y\_2)$ be the coordinates of the points $Q$, $M$, and $N$, respectively. Since the line $OQ$ has a slope $m$, we have $x = my$ as the equation of $OQ$. Therefore, the equation of $MN$ is $x = my + 1$.

We can rewrite the equation of the ellipse $C$ as follows:

$
\begin{cases}
x = my \\
\frac{x^{2}}{3} + \frac{y^{2}}{2} = 1
\end{cases}
$

Solving this system of equations, we obtain:

$
\begin{cases}
x\_0^2 = \frac{6m^2}{2m^2 + 3} \\
y\_0^2 = \frac{6}{2m^2 + 3}
\end{cases}
$

Now, let's calculate the length of $|OQ|$:

$|OQ| = \sqrt{1 + m^{2}} \cdot |y\_0| = \frac{\sqrt{6}\sqrt{1 + m^{2}}}{\sqrt{2m^{2} + 3}}$

Similarly, we can find the coordinates of points $M$ and $N$ by solving the system of equations:

$
\begin{cases}
x = my + 1 \\
\frac{x^{2}}{3} + \frac{y^{2}}{2} = 1
\end{cases}
$

We obtain the following quadratic equation:

$(2m^2 + 3)y^2 + 4my - 4 = 0$

The sum and product of the roots are given by:

$y\_1 + y\_2 = -\frac{4m}{2m^2 + 3}$

$y\_1y\_2 = -\frac{4}{2m^2 + 3}$

Now, let's calculate the length of $|MN|$:

$|MN| = \sqrt{1 + m^{2}} \cdot |y\_1 - y\_2| = \sqrt{1 + m^{2}} \cdot \sqrt{(y\_1 + y\_2)^2 - 4y\_1y\_2}$

$|MN| = \sqrt{1 + m^{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{16m^2}{(2m^2 + 3)^2} + \frac{16}{2m^2 + 3}}$

$|MN| = \sqrt{1 + m^{2}} \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{3}\sqrt{1 + m^{2}}}{2m^2 + 3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}(1 + m^{2})}{2m^2 + 3}$

Finally, we can express the ratio $\frac{|MN|}{|OQ|}$ as:

$\frac{|MN|}{|OQ|} = \frac{\frac{4\sqrt{3}(1 + m^{2})}{2m^2 + 3}}{\sqrt{\frac{6(1 + m^{2})}{2m^2 + 3}}} = 2\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + m^{2}}{2m^{2} + 3}}$

Since $1 + m^{2} \geq 1$, we have $0 < \frac{1}{1 + m^{2}} \leq 1$, which implies $2 < 2 + \frac{1}{1 + m^{2}} \leq 3$. Consequently, $\frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{1 + m^{2}}} < \frac{1}{2}$.
